This is maven project so you will need maven installed. https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
To run the annotation viewer with maven type: mvn install exec:exec
For the field "Location of Analysis Engine XML Descriptor:" you should use the file EmptyAEDescriptor.xml located in src/main/resources.
For the field "Output Directory" you should use a directory such as /parsed_data/secondpass_NLPparsed with .xmi files compiled.
To view those files hit the "View" button on the lower right.
Nothing bad will happen if you hit the "Interactive" button but nothing interesting will happen either.
Beware if you hit the "Run" button because this will overright the xmi files.
